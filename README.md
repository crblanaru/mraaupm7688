This is my first attempt at recreating the makefiles for the latest version of libupm and libmraa on the Linkit Smart 7688.
Please consider this an untested, development version if you try to build the packages yourself at this stage.
This project started from the need to use newer sensors that were not present in libupm when they were built for the 7688.
